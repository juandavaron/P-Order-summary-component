### What I learned
[Top](#table-of-contents)


For this project I started using the BEM methodology. It was helpful mixing it with the SASS pre-processor and it helped me to speed up the process.

```html
<div class="main__container">
  <div class="main__item"></div>
</div>
```
```scss
.main{
  &__container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }

  &__item{
    background-color: #fff;

    &:hover{
      background-color: #000
    }
  }
}
```
